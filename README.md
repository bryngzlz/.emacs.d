# .emacs.d - My Emacs config

This repo contains my personal Emacs configuration. I am a total Emacs noob, but I'll be documenting the cool stuff I learn
and add to this config over on my [blog](https://zacwood9.github.io), so feel free to check that out if you want
to see my thought process of leave any tips.
